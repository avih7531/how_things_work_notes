## Capacitors and Conductors
### Capacitors
- **Capacitors** are devices that store energy in the form of an electric field.
  - At equilibrium, the electric field is zero and voltage and constant
  - Capacitance is the ability of a system to store charge.
- The capacitance of a capacitor is given by the formula:
  \[
  C = \frac{Q}{V}
  \]
  - Where 
    - \(C\) is the capacitance in farads (F), 
    - \(Q\) is the charge
    - \(V\) is the voltage.
- The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:
  \[
  U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2
  \]
  - Where 
    - \(U\) is the energy stored in the capacitor.
- See section [Schematic Symbols](#schematic-symbols) for common capacitor symbols.

### Conductors
- **Conductors** are materials that allow the flow of electric current.
  - Conductors have a low resistance to the flow of electric current.

## Batteries
- **Batteries** are devices that store energy in the form of chemical energy.
  - They are used as a voltage source in electric circuits.
  - Most batteries are lithium-ion batteries.
    - They have LiCoO2 cathodes (+) and graphite anodes (-).
    - They have an electrolyte that allows the flow of ions.
  - The voltage of a battery is the potential difference between the positive and negative terminals of the battery.
    - Thus measuring the voltage across terminals and then switching the terminals will give the negative of the original voltage.
- The energy stored in a battery is given by the formula:
  \[
  E = VQ
  \]
  - Where 
    - \(E\) is the energy stored in the battery.
    - \(V\) is the voltage of the battery.
    - \(Q\) is the charge.

## Current
- **Current** is the flow of electric charge.
  - The SI unit of current is the ampere \(A\) where \(A = \frac{C}{s}\).

### Ohm's Law
- **Ohm's Law** states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.
  - The formula for Ohm's Law is:
    \[
    I = \frac{V}{R}
    \]
    - Where 
      - \(I\) is the current in amperes (A).
      - \(V\) is the voltage in volts (V).
      - \(R\) is the resistance in ohms (\(\Omega\)).

## Resistance
- **Resistance** is the opposition to the flow of electric current.
  - The SI unit of resistance is the ohm (\(\Omega\)).
- The resistance of a conductor is given by the formula:
  \[
  R = \frac{V}{I}
  \]
  - Where 
    - \(R\) is the resistance in ohms (\(\Omega\)).
    - \(V\) is the voltage in volts (V).
    - \(I\) is the current in amperes (A).
- *Resistors* are devices that are used to control the flow of electric current in a circuit.
  - See section [Schematic Symbols](#schematic-symbols) for common resistor symbols.

## Electric Power
- **Electric Power** is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit.
  - The formula for electric power is:
    \[
    P = IV
    \]
    - Where 
      - \(P\) is the power in watts (W).
      - \(I\) is the current in amperes (A).
      - \(V\) is the voltage in volts (V).
- The energy consumed by an electric circuit is given by the formula:
  \[
  E = Pt
  \]
  - Where 
    - \(E\) is the energy consumed in joules (J).
    - \(P\) is the power in watts (W).
    - \(t\) is the time in seconds (s). 

## Electric Circuits
- **Electric Circuits** are systems that allow the flow of electric current.
  - Electric circuits are made up of components such as resistors, capacitors, and batteries.

### Types of Electric Circuits
- There are two types of electric circuits: 
  - **Series Circuits**: Components are connected in a single path.
    - Resistors in series add up to the total resistance.
    - \(R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \ldots + R_n\)
  - **Parallel Circuits**: Components are connected in multiple paths.
    - Resistors in parallel add up to the reciprocal of the total resistance.
    - \(\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n}\)
- Larger circuits can be made up of series and parallel circuits.
