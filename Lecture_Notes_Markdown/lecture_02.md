## Newton's First Law of Motion
- *An object subject to no external forces moves at a constant velocity.*
- Equation of predicting an object at constant velocity: `xf-> = xi-> + v->*(tf-ti)`
  - `xf->`: final position vector
  - `xi->`: initial position vector
  - `v->`: velocity vector
  - `tf`: final time
  - `ti`: initial time
- The amount by which an object moves is the velocity times the time.

$\vec{x}_f = \vec{x}_i + \vec{v} \cdot (t_f - t_i)$
