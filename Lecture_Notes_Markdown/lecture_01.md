### Vectors & Scalars
- Scaler  
  - A quantity that has magnitude only
- Vectors are quantities that have both *magnitude* and *direction*
  - Magnitude
    - The size of the vector
    - Examples: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$
  - Direction
    - The direction the vector is pointing
    - Examples: North, South, East, West
  - Examples: Velocity, force, displacement
  - Position vector
    - A vector that points from the origin to a point in space
    - Example: home is $\langle 0, 0 \rangle$, lecture hall is $\langle -1, 3 \rangle$, and coffee shop is $\langle 2, 2 \rangle$
      - The noted as $\vec{V}$ from home to lecture hall is **$X$ mph north**
       - $\hat{V}$ = **north**
       - $|\vec{V}|$ = **$X$**
      - To go from the lecture hall to the coffee shop, you would go **$X$ MPH east**
       - To get the vector length, you would use the Pythagorean theorem (where vector length is the hypotenuse)
         - $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$
         - $\sqrt{(2-(-1))^2 + (2-3)^2}$ = 
         - $\sqrt{3^2 + (-1)^2}$ =
         - $\sqrt{9 + 1}$ = 
         - **$\sqrt{10}$**
       - To get the vector displacement, you would subtract the two vectors
         - $\langle x_2, y_2 \rangle - \langle x_1, y_1 \rangle = \langle x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1 \rangle$
         - $2-(-1) = 3$ and $2-3 = -1$ and thus the vector displacement is **$\langle 3, -1 \rangle$**

### Units
- Dimensionless numbers
  - Numbers that have no units
      - Examples: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$
  - Dimensional numbers
    - Numbers that have units
      - Examples: $100W$, $10kg$, $25V$
  - Examples: The temperature in a room, the mass of an object
- Dimensional Scalers
  - Dimensionless number **x** unit
    - Examples: $1m$, $2kg$, $3s$, $300,000m/s$

| Temperature         | Fahrenheit ($F$), Celsius ($C$), Kelvin ($K$) |
