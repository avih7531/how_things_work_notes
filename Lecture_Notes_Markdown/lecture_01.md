### Vectors & Scalars
- Scaler  
  - A quantity that has magnitude only
- Vectors are quantities that have both *magnitude* and *direction*
  - Magnitude
    - The size of the vector
    - Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4
  - Direction
    - The direction the vector is pointing
    - Examples: North, South, East, West
  - Examples: Velocity, force, displacement
  - Position vector
    - A vector that points from the origin to a point in space
    - Example: home is `<0, 0>`, lecture hall is `<-1, 3>`, and coffee shop is `<2, 2>`
      - The noted as `V->` from home to lecture hall is **X mph north**
       - `V^` = **north**
       - `|V->|` = **X**
      - To go from the lecture hall to the coffee shop, you would go **X MPH east**
       - To get the vector length, you would use the Pythagorean theorem (where vector length is the hypotenuse)
         - `√((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)`
         - `√((2-(-1))^2 + (2-3)^2)` = 
         - `√(3^2 + (-1)^2)` =
         - `√(9 + 1)` = 
         - **√(10)**
       - To get the vector displacement, you would subtract the two vectors
         - `<x2, y2> - <x1, y1> = <x2-x1, y2-y1>`
         - `2-(-1) = 3` and `2-3 = -1` and thus the vector displacement is **<3, -1>**

### Units
- Dimensionless numbers
  - Numbers that have no units
      - Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4
  - Dimensional numbers
    - Numbers that have units
      - Examples: 100W, 10kg, 25V
  - Examples: The tempature in a room, the mass of an object
- Dimensional Scalers
  - Dimensionless number **x** unit
    - Examples: 1m, 2kg, 3s, 300,000m/s

| Angle               | Radians (`rad`), `1` degree = `π/180` radians |
| Mass                | Kilograms (`kg`)                              |
| Speed               | Meters per second (`m/s`)                     |
| Force               | Newtons (`kg*m/s^2`)                          |
| Temperature         | Fahrenheit (`F`), Celsius (`C`), Kelvin (`K`) |
