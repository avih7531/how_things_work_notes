### Question 1
A car is moving with an initial velocity of \( \vec{v_i} = (-20 \, \text{m/s}, 0, 0) \) and comes to a stop in a time of 10 seconds with a constant deceleration. What is the acceleration vector?

- **(a)** \( \vec{a} = (1 \, \text{m/s}^2, 0, 0) \)
- **(b)** \( \vec{a} = (-1 \, \text{m/s}^2, 0, 0) \)
- **(c)** \( \vec{a} = (2 \, \text{m/s}^2, 0, 0) \)
- **(d)** \( \vec{a} = (-2 \, \text{m/s}^2, 0, 0) \)

#### Solution:
To find the acceleration, we can use the kinematic equation:

\[
\vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\vec{v}_f - \vec{v}_i}{\Delta t}
\]

Given that the car's final velocity (\( \vec{v}_f \)) is 0 m/s and the initial velocity is \( -20 \, \text{m/s} \) over a time interval of \( 10 \, \text{seconds} \):

\[
\vec{a} = \frac{0 - (-20)}{10} = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

The correct answer is **(c)**: \( \vec{a} = (2 \, \text{m/s}^2, 0, 0) \).

---

### Question 2
When you go skydiving, after reaching terminal velocity (about 50 m/s), what can be said about your acceleration?

- **(a)** You are accelerating because there are forces acting on your body.
- **(b)** You are accelerating downward because of gravity.
- **(c)** You are not accelerating because you are moving at constant velocity.
- **(d)** You are decelerating because of air drag.

#### Solution:
At terminal velocity, the forces acting on you (gravity and air resistance) are balanced, resulting in zero net force. According to **Newton’s First Law of Motion**, an object with no net force acting on it moves at a constant velocity:

\[
\text{Acceleration} = \frac{0}{\text{mass}} = 0
\]

Thus, there is no acceleration. The correct answer is **(c)**: You are not accelerating because you are moving at constant velocity.

---

### Question 3
At a speed of \(12 \, \text{m/s}\), how far can you travel in one minute?

- **(a)** 12 m
- **(b)** 72 m
- **(c)** 60 m
- **(d)** 720 m

#### Solution:
Distance traveled is calculated by:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

At \(12 \, \text{m/s}\), and given that 1 minute is \(60 \, \text{seconds}\), the distance is:

\[
\text{Distance} = 12 \, \text{m/s} \times 60 \, \text{s} = 720 \, \text{m}
\]

The correct answer is **(d)**: 720 m.

---

### Question 4
The gravitational acceleration on the Moon is about 6 times smaller than on Earth. How long does it take for a rock on the Moon to fall 1 m (from rest)?

- **(a)** Around 0.5 s
- **(b)** A little less than 1 s
- **(c)** A little over 1 s
- **(d)** Around 3 s

#### Solution:
On the Moon, the gravitational acceleration \(g_{\text{moon}} \approx \frac{g_{\text{earth}}}{6} = 1.63 \, \text{m/s}^2\). Using the kinematic equation:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

Solving for \(t\) when \(\Delta y = 1 \, \text{m}\):

\[
t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1}{1.63}} \approx 1.1 \, \text{seconds}
\]

The correct answer is **(c)**: A little over 1 s.

---

### Question 5
A gymnast jumps upward with an initial speed of \(10 \, \text{m/s}\). She is in the air for a total time of:

- **(a)** 1 s
- **(b)** 5 s
- **(c)** 2 s
- **(d)** 10 s

#### Solution:
The time of flight for an object under gravity can be found using:

\[
t_{\text{total}} = \frac{2v_i}{g}
\]

Where \(v_i = 10 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\):

\[
t_{\text{total}} = \frac{2 \times 10}{9.8} \approx 2 \, \text{seconds}
\]

The correct answer is **(c)**: 2 s.

---

### Question 6
The maximum height above the ground for the gymnast jumping straight upward with an initial speed of \(10 \, \text{m/s}\) is:

- **(a)** 5 m
- **(b)** 10 m
- **(c)** 2 m
- **(d)** 15 m

#### Solution:
The maximum height can be found using the following kinematic equation:

\[
h = \frac{v_i^2}{2g}
\]

Where \(v_i = 10 \, \text{m/s}\) and \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\):

\[
h = \frac{(10)^2}{2 \times 9.8} \approx 5 \, \text{m}
\]

The correct answer is **(a)**: 5 m.

---

### Question 7
Suppose a 2 kg object is falling through the air and accelerating downwards at \(8 \, \text{m/s}^2\). What is the magnitude and direction of the force of air resistance on it?

- **(a)** 4N upward
- **(b)** 4N downward
- **(c)** 2N upward
- **(d)** 2N downward

#### Solution:
The gravitational force acting on the object is:

\[
F_g = m \cdot g = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 19.6 \, \text{N} \, \text{downward}
\]

The net force is \(F_{\text{net}} = m \cdot a = 2 \, \text{kg} \times 8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 16 \, \text{N} \, \text{downward}\). The air resistance (\(F_{\text{air}}\)) must counteract part of the gravitational force:

\[
F_{\text{air}} = F_g - F_{\text{net}} = 19.6 \, \text{N} - 16 \, \text{N} = 3.6 \, \text{N} \, \text{upward}
\]

The closest answer is **(a)**: 4N upward.

---

### Question 8
Suppose your car is on a 5% grade, meaning for every 100 m you travel along the road, you raise or lower 5 m in elevation. If your car weighs 1500 kg, what is the component of its weight parallel to the road?

- **(a)** 15000 N
- **(b)** 1500 N
- **(c)** 7500 N
- **(d)** 750 N

#### Solution:
The weight of the car is:

\[
W = m \cdot g = 1500 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 14700 \, \text{N}
\]

The component of the weight parallel to the incline is:

\[
W_{\parallel} = W \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]

Since \(\sin(\theta) \approx 0.05\) (from the 5% grade), we have:

\[
W_{\parallel} = 14700 \, \text{N} \times 0.05 = 735 \, \text{N}
\]

The closest answer is **(d)**: 750 N.

---

### Question 9
Suppose you push horizontally on the wall of a building. For you to do work on the wall, which of the following need to happen?

- **(a)** The wall moves away from you
- **(b)** The wall lifts up
- **(c)** The wall moves sideways
- **(d)** (b) and (c)

#### Solution:
Work is defined as \(W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta)\), where \(F\) is the force applied, \(d\) is the displacement, and \(\theta\) is the angle between the force and the displacement. For work to be done, the wall must move in the direction of the force applied.

The correct answer is **(a)**: The wall moves away from you.

---

### Question 10
Consider a 100 kg father and his 20 kg daughter on a seesaw. If the daughter sits 2 m from the center, how far should the father sit for balance?

- **(a)** Farther out than the board will allow
- **(b)** 0.5 m
- **(c)** 0.4 m
- **(d)** 1.5 m

#### Solution:
For balance, the torques around the pivot must be equal. Torque is calculated as:

\[
\tau = r \cdot F
\]

Where \(r\) is the distance from the pivot and \(F = m \cdot g\) is the weight. The father’s mass is 100 kg, and the daughter’s mass is 20 kg. Using \(r_f \cdot 100g = 2 \cdot 20g\):

\[
100r_f = 40 \implies r_f = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \, \text{m}
\]

The correct answer is **(c)**: 0.4 m.

---

### Question 11
If the Moon's rotational period doubles, how does its rotational kinetic energy change?

- **(a)** It will double
- **(b)** It will quadruple
- **(c)** It will decrease to 1/2
- **(d)** It will decrease to 1/4

#### Solution:
Rotational kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

Where \(I\) is the moment of inertia and \(\omega\) is the angular velocity. If the period doubles, the angular velocity \(\omega\) is halved. Since kinetic energy depends on \(\omega^2\), halving \(\omega\) reduces the energy by a factor of:

\[
K_{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{4} K_{\text{original}}
\]

The correct answer is **(d)**: It will decrease to 1/4 its original value.

---

### Question 12
If the polar ice caps melt, moving the water to the equator, what happens to the length of a day?

- **(a)** Increase due to friction
- **(b)** Increase due to angular momentum conservation
- **(c)** Decrease due to mass loss
- **(d)** Decrease due to work done by the ice

#### Solution:
Angular momentum is conserved, so:

\[
L = I \omega
\]

Where \(I\) is the moment of inertia and \(\omega\) is the angular velocity. Moving mass from the poles to the equator increases \(I\), so to conserve angular momentum, \(\omega\) must decrease. A decrease in \(\omega\) means the length of the day increases.

The correct answer is **(b)**: Increase due to angular momentum conservation.

---

### Question 13
A 1.2 kg bird sits on a wind turbine blade 10 m from its center. The turbine has a moment of inertia of 240,000 kgm². What is the torque due to the bird, and the angular acceleration of the turbine?

- **(a)** 1,200 Nm; 0.0005 rad/s²
- **(b)** 120 Nm; 0.00005 rad/s²
- **(c)** 2,400 Nm; 0.0005 rad/s²
- **(d)** 120 Nm; 0.20 rad/s²

#### Solution:
The torque due to the bird is:

\[
\tau = r \times F = 10 \, \text{m} \times 1.2 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 120 \, \text{Nm}
\]

The angular acceleration is:

\[
\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} = \frac{120}{240,000} = 0.0005 \, \text{rad/s}^2
\]

The correct answer is **(b)**: 120 Nm; 0.00005 rad/s².

---

### Question 14
If the turbine starts rotating clockwise due to wind, what is the net force and torque?

- **(a)** Positive; towards you
- **(b)** Negative; towards you
- **(c)** Zero; to the left
- **(d)** Zero; away from you

#### Solution:
If the turbine is rotating but not translating, the net translational force is zero. The rotational motion is caused by torque, not translational force.

The correct answer is **(d)**: Zero; away from you.

---

### Question 15
A professor accelerates forward in a car with a coffee cup on the roof. What can be said about the friction acting on the cup?

- **(a)** Its direction is backwards
- **(b)** Its direction is forwards
- **(c)** There is no friction since there is no sliding
- **(d)** The force of friction is infinite

#### Solution:
The force of static friction prevents the cup from sliding backward. Since the car is accelerating forward, static friction must act in the same direction (forwards) to keep the cup in place.

The correct answer is **(b)**: Its direction is forwards.

---

### Question 16
An 800 kg car moving at 4 m/s to the right collides with a 400 kg car moving to the left. After the collision, they stick together and stop moving. What was the velocity of the 400 kg car?

- **(a)** It was stationary
- **(b)** 2 m/s to the left
- **(c)** 8 m/s to the left
- **(d)** 4 m/s to the left

#### Solution:
Using conservation of momentum:

\[
m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = 0
\]

Where \(m_1 = 800 \, \text{kg}\), \(v_1 = 4 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(m_2 = 400 \, \text{kg}\):

\[
800 \times 4 + 400 \times v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = -8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The correct answer is **(c)**: 8 m/s to the left.

---

### Question 17
You place an object on a spring with a spring constant of \(100 \, \text{N/m}\), compressing the spring by 0.05 m. What is the object's mass?

- **(a)** 0.5 kg
- **(b)** 1 kg
- **(c)** 2 kg
- **(d)** 5 kg

#### Solution:
Using Hooke's Law, \(F = kx\), where \(F = mg\):

\[
mg = kx \implies m = \frac{kx}{g} = \frac{100 \times 0.05}{9.8} \approx 0.51 \, \text{kg}
\]

The correct answer is **(a)**: 0.5 kg.

---

### Question 18
You make a spring-loaded catapult with a spring constant of \(400 \, \text{N/m}\), compressing the spring by 0.1 m. What will be the launch speed of a \(0.04 \, \text{kg}\) ball?

- **(a)** 10 m/s
- **(b)** 20 m/s
- **(c)** 40 m/s
- **(d)** 100 m/s

#### Solution:
Using energy conservation, the potential energy stored in the spring is converted to the kinetic energy of the ball:

\[
\frac{1}{2} kx^2 = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
\]

Solving for \(v\):

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{kx^2}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{400 \times (0.1)^2}{0.04}} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The correct answer is **(a)**: 10 m/s.

---

### Question 19
If the shocks on a car are completely gone, and the car bounces at stoplights, how will the bouncing frequency change when more passengers are added?

- **(a)** The frequency will be the same
- **(b)** The frequency will be lower
- **(c)** The frequency will be higher
- **(d)** The frequency cannot be determined without the amplitude

#### Solution:
The bouncing frequency of a car (a harmonic oscillator) is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

Adding more mass (passengers) increases \(m\), reducing the frequency.

The correct answer is **(b)**: The frequency will be lower.

---

### Question 20
When you blow across the top of a soda bottle, it emits a tone. If you replace the air with carbon dioxide, what happens to the pitch?

- **(a)** A higher pitched tone
- **(b)** A tone at the same pitch
- **(c)** No sound at all
- **(d)** A lower pitched tone

#### Solution:
The speed of sound is slower in carbon dioxide compared to air because carbon dioxide is denser. This causes the frequency (and thus the pitch) to decrease:

\[
v = f \lambda \quad (\text{where } v \text{ is the speed of sound})
\]

With a lower speed of sound, the frequency \(f\) decreases.

The correct answer is **(d)**: A lower pitched tone.

---
