## Vectors & Scalars
- Scaler  
  - A quantity that has magnitude only
- Vectors are quantities that have both *magnitude* and *direction*
  - Magnitude
    - The size of the vector
    - Examples: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$
  - Direction
    - The direction the vector is pointing
    - Examples: North, South, East, West
  - Examples: Velocity, force, displacement
  - Position vector
    - A vector that points from the origin to a point in space
    - Example: home is $\langle 0, 0 \rangle$, lecture hall is $\langle -1, 3 \rangle$, and coffee shop is $\langle 2, 2 \rangle$
      - The noted as $\vec{V}$ from home to lecture hall is **$X$ mph north**
       - $\hat{V}$ = **north**
       - $|\vec{V}|$ = **$X$**
      - To go from the lecture hall to the coffee shop, you would go **$X$ MPH east**
       - To get the vector length, you would use the Pythagorean theorem (where vector length is the hypotenuse)
         - $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$
         - $\sqrt{(2-(-1))^2 + (2-3)^2}$ = 
         - $\sqrt{3^2 + (-1)^2}$ =
         - $\sqrt{9 + 1}$ = 
         - **$\sqrt{10}$**
       - To get the vector displacement, you would subtract the two vectors
         - $\langle x_2, y_2 \rangle - \langle x_1, y_1 \rangle = \langle x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1 \rangle$
         - $2-(-1) = 3$ and $2-3 = -1$ and thus the vector displacement is **$\langle 3, -1 \rangle$**

## Units
- Dimensionless numbers
  - Numbers that have no units
      - Examples: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$
  - Dimensional numbers

## Newton's Laws of Motion
### Newton's First Law of Motion
- **An object subject to no external forces moves at a constant velocity.**
- Equation of predicting an object at constant velocity: $\vec{x}_f = \vec{x}_i + \vec{v} \cdot (t_f - t_i)$
  - $\vec{x}_f$ is the final position ($m$)
  - $\vec{x}_i$ is the initial position ($m$)
  - $\vec{v}$ is the velocity ($\frac{m}{s}$)
  - $t_f$ is the final time ($s$)
  - $t_i$ is the initial time ($s$)
- Example of finding the final position of an object at constant velocity:
  - What is $\vec{x}_f$ if $\vec{x}_i = (-4, 6, -8)$, $\vec{v} = (2, \frac{-4}{3}, 2)$, $t_f = 3$, and $t_i = 0$?
    - $\vec{x}_f = \vec{x}_i + \vec{v} \cdot (t_f - t_i)$
    - $\vec{x}_f = (-4, 6, -8) + (2, \frac{-4}{3}, 2) \cdot (3)$
    - $\vec{x}_f = (-4, 6, -8) + (6, -4, 6)$
    - $\vec{x}_f = (2, 2, -2)$

### Newton's Second Law of Motion
- **The acceleration that an object experiences is equal to the net force exerted on it divided by the object's mass.**
- Equation of predicting the acceleration of an object: $\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}_{\text{net}}}{m}$
  - $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration ($\frac{m}{s^2}$)
  - $\vec{F}_{\text{net}}$ is the net force ($N \cdot m$ *Newton meters*)
  - $m$ is the mass of the object ($kg$)
- Equation of predicting an object's final velocity: $\vec{v}_f = \vec{v}_i + \vec{a} \cdot (t_f - t_i)$
  - $\vec{v}_f$ is the final velocity ($\frac{m}{s}$)
  - $\vec{v}_i$ is the initial velocity ($\frac{m}{s}$)
  - $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration ($\frac{m}{s^2}$)
  - $t_f$ is the final time ($s$)
  - $t_i$ is the initial time ($s$)
- Equation for finding the average velocity of an object: $\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\vec{v}_i + \vec{v}_f}{2}$
  - $\vec{v}_{\text{avg}}$ is the average velocity ($\frac{m}{s}$)
  - $\vec{v}_i$ is the initial velocity ($\frac{m}{s}$)
  - $\vec{v}_f$ is the final velocity ($\frac{m}{s}$)
- By integrating the average velocity over the time interval, we get the equation for the final position:
  $\vec{x}_f = \vec{x}_i + \vec{v}_i \cdot (t_f - t_i) + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a} \cdot (t_f - t_i)^2$
  - $\vec{x}_f$ is the final position
  - $\vec{x}_i$ is the initial position
  - $\vec{v}_i$ is the initial velocity
  - $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration
  - $t_f$ is the final time
  - $t_i$ is the initial time

### Newton's Third Law of Motion
- *For every force from an object A exterted to B, there is an equal in magnitude and opposite in direction force from B exerted to A.*
- $\vec{F}_{\text{BA}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{AB}}$
  - "The force exerted by A on B is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by B on A."


## Gravitational Force
| Force            | Symbol       | Description                                                                 | Direction                                      |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Gravitational    | $\vec{F}_g$ or $\vec{w}$ = $\vec{\text{weight}}$ | The force of attraction between two masses. $\vec{F}_g = (0, 0, -9.81 \frac{m}{s^2})$                                | Towards the center of the Earth (downwards)    |
| Frictional       | $\vec{F}_f$  | The force that opposes the motion of an object.                             | Opposite to the direction of motion            |
| Normal           | $\vec{F}_N$  | The support force exerted by a surface perpendicular to the object.         | Perpendicular to the surface (upwards)         |
| Drag             | $\vec{F}_d$  | The force that opposes the motion of an object through a fluid.             | Opposite to the direction of motion            |
- The *equivelence principle* states that the force of gravity is equivalent to the force of acceleration. This is why objects in free fall experience weightlessness.
- When dropping an object from a height, the object will accelerate downwards at a rate of $-9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$.
  - Putting that into a formula gives us $\vec{x}_f = \vec{x}_i + \vec{v}_i \cdot (t_f - t_i) + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a} \cdot (t_f - t_i)^2$
    - $\vec{X}_i = (0, 0, h)$
    - $\vec{v}_i = (0, 0, 0)$
    - $\vec{a} = \vec{g} = (0, 0, -9.81 \frac{m}{s^2})$
  - Rearranging, $h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot -9.81 \cdot t^2$

## Ramps
### Ramp Anatomy
- Ramps are a simple machine that allow us to lift heavy objects with less force.
```

       ***  |

     *****  | 
    ******  | 
   *******  |  height
  ********  |  ^
 *********  |  |

base -->
```
Here, we can find the angle $\theta$ using the relationship:

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{height}}{\text{base}}$$

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the ramp (hypotenuse) can be calculated if the height and base are known:

$$\text{length} = \sqrt{\text{height}^2 + \text{base}^2}$$

### Gravitational Force on an Inclined Plane

When an object is placed on an inclined plane, the gravitational force acting on it can be resolved into two components:

1. **Parallel Component ($F_{\parallel}$)**: This component acts parallel to the surface of the inclined plane and causes the object to slide down.
2. **Perpendicular Component ($F_{\perp}$)**: This component acts perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane and is responsible for the normal force.
![Inclined Plane Diagram](https://stickmanphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Incline-Plane.jpg)

The gravitational force ($F_g$) acting on the object can be expressed as:

$$F_g = m \cdot g = F_w$$ 

where:
- $m$ is the mass of the object
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($9.8 \text{m/s}^2$)

The parallel and perpendicular components can be calculated using the angle of the incline ($\theta$):

$$F_{\parallel} = F_g \cdot \sin(\theta) = m \cdot g \cdot \sin(\theta)$$

$$F_{\perp} = F_g \cdot \cos(\theta) = m \cdot g \cdot \cos(\theta)$$

### Forces at Work on an Inclined Plane
| Symbol       | Name                   | Description                                                                 | Calculation Formula |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| $F_w$        | Weight                 | The gravitational force acting on the object.                               | $F_w = m \cdot g$   |
| $F_{\perp}$  | Perpendicular Component | The component of the gravitational force acting perpendicular to the surface of the inclined plane. | $F_{\perp} = F_w \cdot \cos(\theta)$ |
| $F_N$        | Normal Force           | The force exerted by the inclined plane on the object, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to $F_{\perp}$. | $F_N = -F_{\perp}$   |
| $F_{\parallel}$ | Parallel Component    | The component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the surface of the inclined plane, causing the object to slide down. | $F_{\parallel} = F_w \cdot \sin(\theta)$ |

## Work
*Work* is the transfer of energy from one object to another
The *Work-Energy Principle* state the work done on an object is equal to the force applied to the object times the distance the object moves in the direction of the force
$$\text{Work} = \vec{\text{F}} \times \vec{\Delta x} = \vec{F} \cdot (\vec{x}_f - \vec{x}_i)$$
$\text{Note that } \vec{F} = \vec{F_{\parallel}} + \vec{F_{\perp}}$
- You only do work if the displacement is a non-zero component of the force

## Rotational Motion
### Units of Motion
| **Translational Motion** | **Rotational Motion** |

| **Velocity**: $\vec{v}$ ($\frac{m}{s}$) | **Angular Velocity**: $\vec{\omega}$ ($\frac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}}$) |
| **Acceleration**: $\vec{a}$  ($\frac{m}{s^2}$) | **Angular Acceleration**: $\vec{\alpha}$  ($\frac{\text{rad}}{s^2}$)|
| **Force**: $\vec{F}$ (N) | **Torque**: $\vec{\tau}$ (Nm) |
| **Mass**: $m$ (kg) | **Rotational Mass/Moment of Inertia**: $I$ (kg m$^2$) |

### Rules
| **Translational Motion**                     | **Rotational Motion**                              |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| No outside forces means constant $\vec{v}$   | No outside torques means constant $\vec{\omega}$   |
| $\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{\text{Fnet}}}{m}$      | $\vec{\alpha} = \frac{\vec{\tau}_{\text{net}}}{I}$ |
| $\vec{F}_{\text{BA}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{AB}}$ | $\vec{\tau}_{\text{BA}} = -\vec{\tau}_{\text{AB}}$ |

### Right Hand Rule
- The right hand rule is used to determine the direction of the angular momentum vector $(\vec{\omega})$.
1. **Identify the Rotation Axis**: Determine the axis around which the object is rotating.
2. **Curl Your Fingers**: Point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the rotation (the direction in which the object is moving).
3. **Thumb Direction**: Extend your thumb perpendicular to your fingers. The direction your thumb points is the direction of the angular momentum vector $(\vec{\omega})$.
- Example
  - If a wheel is rotating counterclockwise when viewed from above, you would:
  - Point your fingers in the direction of the rotation (counterclockwise).
  - Your thumb will point upwards, indicating that the angular momentum vector $(\vec{\omega})$ is directed upwards.
- Trick
  - Clockwise = away from you
  - Counterclockwise = towards you

### Angular Velocity
*Angular velocity* is the rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time.
- $\vec{\omega} = \frac{\vec{\theta}_f - \vec{\theta}_i}{t_f - t_i}$

### Torque
- Torque is the rotational equivalent of force.
- $\vec{\alpha} = \frac{\vec{\tau}_{\text{net}}}{I}$
  - Units of $\vec{\tau}$ are Nm
  - Units of $\vec{\alpha}$ are $\frac{\text{rad}}{s^2}$
- $I$ rotational mass measures $\text{mass} \times \text{distance}^2$
  - Units of $I$ are kg m$^2$
- $\tau = |\vec{\tau}| = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}_\perp$
  - $\vec{r}$ is the distance from the axis of rotation
  - $\vec{F}$ is the force applied
#### Diagram of Torque
![Torque Diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/fOcdDRBrIp5G8LjbYsXORZzam1YwKKHVTKIzpPaU75jFemEVpSrsEDwBht649q1Du5qPChdNMA5DhSIat_sfle9aaX3yFrfWAmrIxZuRVu9XP2i_IpcjyGVYAIyHhHF2)
- Note $\vec{F} = \vec{F}_\perp$

## Friction
- Friction is a force that opposes motion.
  - Static friction prevents motion

  - $\vec{F}_{\text{support}}$ is the support force
- $\hat{F}_{\text{sliding friction}} = -\hat{v}$ if $\vec{v} > 0$
  - $\hat{v}$ is the velocity of the object
- $F_{\text{static friction}} = F_{\text{push}}$ if $F_{\text{push}} < \mu_{\text{static friction}} \cdot F_{\text{support}}$
  - $F_{\text{push}}$ is the force applied to the object
  - $\mu_{\text{static friction}}$ is the coefficient of static friction
  - $F_{\text{support}}$ is the support force

## Wheels
- Wheels are a type of simple machine which are used to reduce friction and make it easier to move objects.
- $\vec{v}_{\text{ground}}$ must be $0$ which means that the wheel is not slipping (because wheels *roll*) and so $\vec{v}_{\text{contact point}} = \vec{v}_{\text{ground}}$.
  - No work down by frictional forces from the ground to the wheel.
- $\vec{v}_{\text{top}} = \vec{v}_{\text{contact point}}$

### Diagram of Forces on a Wheel
![Diagram of Forces on a Wheel](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282517347/figure/fig3/AS:669953812344839@1536740844428/Scheme-of-forces-acting-on-rotating-wheel.png)
### Angular Velocity of a Wheel
